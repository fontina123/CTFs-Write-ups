This time, inspecting the Admin Login site, we will see a hidden tag looking something like this:

[<input type="hidden" name="debug" value="1">]


Set [value="0"]. This will help make the CTF easier (although it won't be necessary).
The previous trick we did would work with the [admin' --]

Just make sure not to use the 'or 1=1;-- injection, the website is filtering the password.
